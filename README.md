üñºÔ∏è Image-Based Search Engine using CNN and KNN
This project is a content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system that enables users to find visually similar products using image inputs instead of keyword searches. It was developed in response to a real-world business problem where customers were struggling to discover competitively priced items on a retail website, often missing cheaper alternatives that the store actually stocked.

üîç Project Overview
Context
A retail client approached us after analyzing customer feedback, which revealed a consistent problem:
Customers were unaware of lower-priced alternatives to premium products available on the site, largely due to difficulty navigating and searching for items visually.

To address this, we proposed a proof-of-concept solution leveraging deep learning and computer vision ‚Äî building on previous work with CNN-based models ‚Äî to enable image-based search functionality.

üß† Methodology
1. Feature Extraction with VGG16
    Implemented pre-trained VGG16 from Keras applications.
    
    Replaced the final MaxPooling layer with a Global Average Pooling layer.
    
    The network outputs a single, dense feature vector per image instead of multidimensional arrays.

2. Dataset Processing
    Pre-processed a base set of 300 product images.
    
    Extracted and stored their feature vectors using the VGG16 model.
    
    On querying, the input image is pre-processed and passed through the same model to extract its vector.

3. Similarity Matching
    Cosine Similarity is used to compare the query vector against the base vectors.
    
    Returns the top N most similar images from the dataset based on smallest cosine distance.

üìä Results
    Tested with multiple example images and visualized the top results along with cosine similarity scores.
    
    Output results are intuitive and validate the effectiveness of using feature vectors for visual similarity.

üìà Discussion & Next Steps
Current implementation is a working prototype in a single script. Production deployment would:

    Modularize the code.
    
    Persist the Nearest Neighbors model and vector store.
    
    Enable real-time updates (adding/removing products from the store).
    
    Serve image file paths for frontend display (instead of using Matplotlib).

Future directions include:

    Expanding to multiple product categories.
    
    Comparing additional distance metrics beyond cosine similarity.
    
    Evaluating with customer feedback or click-through rates.
    
    Testing other pre-trained architectures (e.g., ResNet, Inception, DenseNet).
